# rxjs fromEvent Operator

1. It will create an Observable that will emit events of a specfic type coming from the given event target.
2. We can bind target events and methods to make sure we get Observable as output.

## Example

_const students = fromEvent(target, eventName: String, options?: EventListenersOptions)_
